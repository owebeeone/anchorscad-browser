## AnchorSCAD Browser (static build)

This repository hosts a static build of the AnchorSCAD Viewer plus a snapshot of the latest generated models from `anchorscad-core`, produced by `anchorscad-runner.py`. It is intended for publishing as a simple, fast, read-only viewer (no backend) via GitHub Pages.

### Live viewer

- GitHub Pages: [https://<your-user-or-org>.github.io/anchorscad-browser](https://<your-user-or-org>.github.io/anchorscad-browser) — placeholder link; will be updated when published.

### What this contains

- The compiled UI from `anchorscad-viewer`.
- Pre-generated model assets (e.g., STL, PNG, SCAD, SVG) plus a `public/status.json` index used by the viewer for navigation and deep-links to source.

### Where the pieces come from

- Viewer UI: `anchorscad-viewer` ([GitHub](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad-viewer))
- Models and examples: `anchorscad-core` ([GitHub](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad-core)), generated by `anchorscad-runner.py`

Version pointers (to be updated on each publish):

- Viewer commit: `<viewer-commit>`
- Core commit (models): `<core-commit>`

### Build your own

If you want to regenerate the content of this static viewer:

1) Generate models and `status.json` using `anchorscad-core` (invoking `anchorscad-runner.py`).
2) Build the UI from `anchorscad-viewer` and ensure the generated assets and `public/status.json` are included in the build output.
